# Notification Subscriptions: Scoped Subscribe & Deduplication

## Status
**Design** | March 2026

## Problem

The current notification system only allows subscriptions to be created at agent-start time via the `--notify` flag. This creates several limitations:

1. **No post-creation subscription**: A user or agent cannot subscribe to notifications for an agent they did not create, or after the agent is already running.
2. **No grove-wide subscription**: There is no way to say "notify me about all agents in this grove" — subscriptions are strictly per-agent.
3. **No independent subscription management**: Subscriptions are a side-effect of `scion start --notify`, not a first-class resource with its own CRUD lifecycle.
4. **No deduplication across overlapping scopes**: If grove-wide subscriptions are added, a subscriber watching both a specific agent and its parent grove would receive duplicate notifications.

### Motivating Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Human monitoring a grove**
A user wants to be notified whenever any agent in their project grove completes or needs input, without having to subscribe individually to each agent.

**Scenario 2: Lead agent subscribing to a peer**
Agent A is a coordinator. Agent B was started by a different entity. Agent A wants to subscribe to Agent B's status to react when it completes.

**Scenario 3: Overlapping subscriptions**
Agent A subscribes to all events for Agent B, Agent C, and Grove Foo. Agent C is in Grove Foo. When Agent C completes, Agent A should receive exactly one notification — not two (one from the agent subscription and one from the grove subscription).

## Current Architecture

### Subscription Model (as-is)

```go
// pkg/store/models.go
type NotificationSubscription struct {
    ID                string    // UUID
    AgentID           string    // Agent being watched (always required today)
    SubscriberType    string    // "agent" | "user"
    SubscriberID      string    // Slug or ID of the subscriber
    GroveID           string    // Grove scope (used for authorization)
    TriggerActivities []string  // e.g. ["COMPLETED", "WAITING_FOR_INPUT"]
    CreatedAt         time.Time
    CreatedBy         string
}
```

### Current Subscription Creation Flow

1. `scion start --notify` sets `CreateAgentRequest.Notify = true`
2. Hub handler resolves subscriber identity from JWT
3. Creates a `NotificationSubscription` with `AgentID` = newly created agent
4. `NotificationDispatcher.handleEvent()` queries `GetNotificationSubscriptions(agentID)` to find matching subscriptions

### Key Constraint

The `notification_subscriptions` table has `agent_id TEXT NOT NULL` with a foreign key to `agents(id)`. Every subscription is scoped to a single agent. The dispatcher only queries by `agent_id`.

---

## Design

### Subscription Scope Model

Introduce an explicit scope to subscriptions. A subscription targets either a single agent or an entire grove:

```go
const (
    SubscriptionScopeAgent = "agent"  // Watch a specific agent
    SubscriptionScopeGrove = "grove"  // Watch all agents in a grove
)

type NotificationSubscription struct {
    ID                string
    Scope             string    // "agent" or "grove" (NEW)
    AgentID           string    // Required when Scope="agent", empty when Scope="grove"
    SubscriberType    string    // "agent" | "user"
    SubscriberID      string
    GroveID           string    // Always required (grove context)
    TriggerActivities []string
    CreatedAt         time.Time
    CreatedBy         string
}
```

### Schema Changes

```sql
-- Migration: alter notification_subscriptions
-- 1. Make agent_id nullable (grove-scoped subscriptions have no agent_id)
-- 2. Add scope column
-- 3. Add unique constraint to prevent duplicate subscriptions

ALTER TABLE notification_subscriptions ADD COLUMN scope TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'agent';

-- Drop the existing NOT NULL on agent_id by recreating the table
-- (SQLite doesn't support ALTER COLUMN)
CREATE TABLE notification_subscriptions_new (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    scope TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'agent',       -- 'agent' | 'grove'
    agent_id TEXT,                              -- NULL for grove-scoped
    subscriber_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    subscriber_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    grove_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    trigger_activities TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (agent_id) REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Unique constraint: one subscription per (scope, target, subscriber, activities-hash)
-- prevents exact duplicates but allows different activity sets
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_notification_subs_unique
    ON notification_subscriptions(scope, COALESCE(agent_id, ''), subscriber_type, subscriber_id, grove_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_notification_subs_agent ON notification_subscriptions(agent_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_notification_subs_grove ON notification_subscriptions(grove_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_notification_subs_subscriber ON notification_subscriptions(subscriber_type, subscriber_id);
```

### Dispatcher Changes: Grove-Scoped Matching + Deduplication

The `handleEvent()` method currently only queries agent-level subscriptions. It must also query grove-level subscriptions and deduplicate:

```go
func (nd *NotificationDispatcher) handleEvent(evt Event) {
    // ... unmarshal event ...

    // Collect subscriptions from both scopes
    agentSubs, _ := nd.store.GetNotificationSubscriptions(ctx, statusEvt.AgentID)
    groveSubs, _ := nd.store.GetNotificationSubscriptionsByGroveScope(ctx, statusEvt.GroveID)
    allSubs := append(agentSubs, groveSubs...)

    // Deduplicate: one notification per (subscriber_type, subscriber_id)
    seen := make(map[string]bool)
    for _, sub := range allSubs {
        dedupeKey := sub.SubscriberType + ":" + sub.SubscriberID
        if seen[dedupeKey] {
            continue
        }
        if !sub.MatchesActivity(matchStatus) {
            continue
        }
        // ... dedup against last notification status ...
        seen[dedupeKey] = true
        nd.storeAndDispatch(ctx, &sub, statusEvt)
    }
}
```

**Deduplication strategy**: When an event matches multiple subscriptions for the same subscriber (e.g., agent-scoped + grove-scoped), only the first matching subscription generates a notification. Agent-scoped subscriptions take priority (queried first) since they are more specific.

### New Store Methods

```go
// GetNotificationSubscriptionsByGroveScope returns grove-scoped subscriptions
// (scope='grove') for a given grove, as opposed to GetNotificationSubscriptionsByGrove
// which returns ALL subscriptions within a grove regardless of scope.
GetNotificationSubscriptionsByGroveScope(ctx context.Context, groveID string) ([]NotificationSubscription, error)

// GetSubscriptionsForSubscriber returns all subscriptions owned by a subscriber.
GetSubscriptionsForSubscriber(ctx context.Context, subscriberType, subscriberID string) ([]NotificationSubscription, error)
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints

```
POST   /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions          — Create a subscription
GET    /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions          — List subscriptions for the caller
DELETE /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions/{id}     — Delete a subscription
```

### Create Subscription

```
POST /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
    "scope": "agent",
    "agentId": "uuid-of-agent",
    "groveId": "uuid-of-grove",
    "triggerActivities": ["COMPLETED", "WAITING_FOR_INPUT", "LIMITS_EXCEEDED"]
}
```

Or for grove-wide:
```json
{
    "scope": "grove",
    "groveId": "uuid-of-grove",
    "triggerActivities": ["COMPLETED", "WAITING_FOR_INPUT"]
}
```

**Validation:**
- `scope` must be `"agent"` or `"grove"`
- `agentId` required when scope is `"agent"`, must be empty when scope is `"grove"`
- `groveId` always required
- `triggerActivities` must be non-empty, values must be from allowed set
- Subscriber identity resolved from JWT (same pattern as `--notify`)
- Duplicate detection: if an identical subscription already exists, return the existing one (idempotent)

**Response:** `201 Created` with the subscription object.

### List Subscriptions

```
GET /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions
    ?groveId=...          (optional, filter by grove)
    ?agentId=...          (optional, filter by watched agent)
    ?scope=agent|grove    (optional, filter by scope)
```

Returns subscriptions owned by the authenticated caller.

### Delete Subscription

```
DELETE /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions/{id}
```

Only the subscription owner (or hub admin) can delete. Returns `204 No Content`.

---

## CLI Design

All subscription management lives under a new `scion notifications` command group. Usage requires hub mode — non-hub invocations return an error.

### Command Structure

```
scion notifications                           — List your notifications (alias for current `scion hub notifications`)
scion notifications ack [id]                  — Acknowledge notification(s) (--all flag for bulk)
scion notifications subscribe                 — Create a subscription
scion notifications unsubscribe [id]          — Remove a subscription
scion notifications subscriptions             — List your subscriptions
```

### Subscribe Command

```bash
# Subscribe to a specific agent
scion notifications subscribe --agent <agent-name-or-id> --grove <grove>

# Subscribe to all agents in a grove
scion notifications subscribe --grove <grove>

# Subscribe with specific triggers (default: COMPLETED, WAITING_FOR_INPUT, LIMITS_EXCEEDED)
scion notifications subscribe --agent <agent> --grove <grove> --triggers COMPLETED,WAITING_FOR_INPUT

# Subscribe from within an agent context (uses JWT identity)
scion notifications subscribe --agent <peer-agent-slug>
```

**Behavior:**
- `--grove` is always required (can be inferred from current context like other commands)
- If only `--grove` is provided (no `--agent`), creates a grove-scoped subscription
- If `--agent` is provided, creates an agent-scoped subscription
- `--triggers` defaults to `COMPLETED,WAITING_FOR_INPUT,LIMITS_EXCEEDED`
- Idempotent — re-subscribing with same parameters returns existing subscription

### Unsubscribe Command

```bash
# Unsubscribe by subscription ID
scion notifications unsubscribe <subscription-id>

# Unsubscribe from everything in a grove
scion notifications unsubscribe --grove <grove> --all
```

### List Subscriptions

```bash
# List all your subscriptions
scion notifications subscriptions

# Filter by grove
scion notifications subscriptions --grove <grove>

# JSON output
scion notifications subscriptions --json
```

**Output format:**
```
ID          SCOPE    TARGET           GROVE       TRIGGERS                                    CREATED
a1b2c3d4    agent    my-agent         my-project  COMPLETED,WAITING_FOR_INPUT,LIMITS_EXCEEDED  2026-03-18
e5f6g7h8    grove    (all agents)     my-project  COMPLETED,WAITING_FOR_INPUT                  2026-03-17
```

### Hub Requirement

```go
func runNotificationsSubscribe(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    settings, err := config.LoadSettings(resolvedPath)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to load settings: %w", err)
    }
    if !settings.IsHubEnabled() {
        return fmt.Errorf("notifications require Hub mode. Enable with 'scion hub enable <endpoint>'")
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Migration from `scion hub notifications`

The existing `scion hub notifications` and `scion hub notifications ack` commands move to the new `scion notifications` group. No aliases or deprecation notices — the old `hub notifications` path is simply removed.
---

## Web UX

### Subscription Management Panel

A new "Subscriptions" section appears in two locations:

#### 1. Agent Detail Page — "Subscribe" Action Button

On the agent detail page, add a "Subscribe" button to the header actions area (alongside existing actions like Stop, Delete, etc.):

- **Bell icon button**: Toggles subscription for the current user to this agent
- **State**: Filled bell = subscribed, outline bell = not subscribed
- **Click behavior**:
  - If not subscribed → creates agent-scoped subscription with default triggers
  - If subscribed → shows popover with current subscription details and "Unsubscribe" option
  - Allows editing trigger activities via checkboxes

#### 2. Grove Detail Page — Subscriptions Section

On the grove detail page, add a "Notification Subscriptions" card/section:

- **"Subscribe to Grove" button**: Creates a grove-scoped subscription
- **Subscription list table**: Shows all subscriptions the current user has within this grove

Table columns:
```
SCOPE       TARGET          TRIGGERS                         ACTIONS
agent       worker-agent    COMPLETED, WAITING_FOR_INPUT     [Edit] [Delete]
grove       (all agents)    COMPLETED                        [Edit] [Delete]
```

- **Edit**: Opens an inline popover (anchored to the row) with checkboxes for trigger activities, allowing the user to update which events fire notifications for that subscription. Saves via PATCH on dismiss.
- **Delete**: Remove subscription with confirmation

#### 3. Notification Tray Enhancement

The existing notification tray in the header already works well. Minimal changes needed:

- Notification items can include a small scope indicator (agent icon vs grove icon) to show where the subscription came from
- "Manage subscriptions" link at the bottom of the tray popover, navigating to a subscriptions list page

#### Component: `subscription-manager.ts`

A reusable Lit component following the `env-var-list.ts` CRUD pattern:

```typescript
@customElement('scion-subscription-manager')
export class ScionSubscriptionManager extends LitElement {
    @property() groveId: string;
    @property() agentId?: string;  // If provided, shows only agent-scoped
    @state() private subscriptions: Subscription[] = [];
    @state() private dialogOpen = false;
    // ... CRUD operations against /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions
}
```

**API calls:**
```
GET    /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions?groveId=...
POST   /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions
DELETE /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions/{id}
```

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Expand `--notify` to Accept Targets

Instead of a separate subscription API, extend `--notify` to accept a target:

```bash
scion start --notify=agent:coordinator fooagent "Do the thing"
```

**Rejected because:**
- Only works at agent creation time — doesn't solve post-creation subscription
- Doesn't address grove-wide subscriptions
- Conflates agent creation with subscription management
- The `--notify` flag should remain simple (boolean, "notify me")

### Alternative B: Topic-Based Pub/Sub (NATS-Style)

Model subscriptions as topic subscriptions on the event bus:

```
# Subscribe to: grove.{id}.agent.status
scion subscribe grove.mygrove.agent.status
```

**Rejected because:**
- Exposes internal event bus topology to users
- Doesn't provide deduplication semantics
- Doesn't fit the "notification" mental model (users think in terms of agents and groves, not event subjects)
- Would require a separate persistence layer anyway for durable subscriptions

### Alternative C: Grove-Level Setting (Auto-Notify All)

Add a grove setting `auto_notify: true` that automatically subscribes the grove owner to all agent events:

```bash
scion grove settings set auto-notify true
```

**Rejected because:**
- Too coarse — no per-user or per-agent granularity
- Doesn't support agent-to-agent subscriptions
- Settings are a different abstraction than subscriptions
- Could be built later on top of the subscription model as a convenience feature

### Alternative D: Wildcard AgentID in Current Schema

Use a sentinel value (e.g., `"*"`) in the existing `agent_id` column to mean "all agents in grove":

```sql
INSERT INTO notification_subscriptions (agent_id, grove_id, ...)
VALUES ('*', 'grove-uuid', ...);
```

**Rejected because:**
- Breaks the foreign key constraint (`agent_id REFERENCES agents(id)`)
- Sentinel values are fragile and error-prone
- Query patterns become awkward (need `WHERE agent_id = ? OR agent_id = '*'`)
- A proper `scope` column is cleaner and more extensible

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Subscription Limits
Should there be a maximum number of subscriptions per subscriber? A user subscribing to 1000 individual agents would create query overhead. **Decision**: No limits initially. Grove-scoped subscriptions naturally reduce the need for many individual subscriptions. A configurable cap can be added later if needed.

### 2. Trigger Activity Editing
Should updating trigger activities on an existing subscription be supported, or should users delete and recreate? **Decision**: Support a PATCH endpoint for modifying `triggerActivities` on an existing subscription. This is cleaner UX than delete+recreate.

### 3. Subscription Persistence After Agent Deletion
Agent-scoped subscriptions cascade-delete when the agent is deleted (via FK constraint). Should there be a notification that the watched agent was deleted? **Decision**: Yes — treat agent deletion as a notification-worthy event (new trigger activity: `DELETED`). The notification is generated before the cascade delete removes the subscription. This aligns naturally with the existing soft-delete model where deletion is a state change.

### 4. Authorization Model
Who can subscribe to what?
- **Users**: Any authenticated user can subscribe to any agent/grove they have read access to
- **Agents**: Can subscribe to any agent in their grove (same grove only, enforced by JWT scope)
- **Cross-grove subscriptions**: Not supported initially

**Decision**: Follow existing authorization patterns — use grove membership or read access as the gate.

### 5. `--notify` Flag Behavior
Should `--notify` continue to create subscriptions as a side-effect, or should it be refactored to call the subscription API internally? **Decision**: Refactor `--notify` to use the new subscription API internally. This unifies the code path, reduces tech debt, and ensures `--notify` subscriptions appear in `scion notifications subscriptions` listings.

### 6. Notification Channels for Subscriptions
Should grove-scoped subscriptions also dispatch to external channels (Slack, webhooks)? **Decision**: Yes — channel dispatch is subscriber-type-dependent (user subscribers get channels), not scope-dependent. Both agent-scoped and grove-scoped subscriptions for user subscribers should dispatch to channels. Notification channels should support brokered channel providers via the broker plugin system.

### 7. CLI Command Placement
The design places commands under `scion notifications` (top-level). An alternative is `scion hub notifications subscribe`. **Decision**: Top-level `scion notifications` — it's shorter, notifications are a platform feature (not a "hub admin" action), and the common case is subscribing within the same grove.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Subscription API + Dispatcher Changes ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Subscriptions are a first-class resource with CRUD API and grove-scoped matching with deduplication.

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Add `scope` column to `NotificationSubscription` model and DB schema migration
2. ✅ Make `agent_id` nullable in the schema (for grove-scoped subscriptions)
3. ✅ Add `GetNotificationSubscriptionsByGroveScope()` and `GetSubscriptionsForSubscriber()` store methods
4. ✅ Implement SQLite store methods
5. ✅ Add unique constraint for duplicate prevention
6. ✅ Update `NotificationDispatcher.handleEvent()` with grove-scope query and deduplication logic
7. ✅ Add HTTP handlers: `POST/GET/DELETE /api/v1/notifications/subscriptions`
8. ✅ Add hubclient `SubscriptionService` interface and implementation
9. ✅ Write unit and integration tests
10. ✅ Refactor `--notify` flag in `createAgent` handler to use the new subscription creation path

### Phase 2: CLI Commands
**Goal**: Users and agents can manage subscriptions from the command line.

**Tasks:**
1. Create `scion notifications` command group with hub-required check
2. Implement `scion notifications subscribe` with `--agent`, `--grove`, `--triggers` flags
3. Implement `scion notifications unsubscribe` command
4. Implement `scion notifications subscriptions` listing command
5. Move `scion hub notifications` / `scion hub notifications ack` to the new `scion notifications` group (remove old commands)
6. Write CLI integration tests

### Phase 3: Web UX
**Goal**: Users can manage subscriptions and see subscription context in the browser.

**Tasks:**
1. Add `Subscription` type to `web/src/shared/types.ts`
2. Create `subscription-manager.ts` shared component (CRUD table + dialog)
3. Add "Subscribe" bell button to agent detail page header
4. Add "Notification Subscriptions" section to grove detail page
5. Add "Manage subscriptions" link to notification tray popover
6. Wire up SSE events for real-time subscription state updates (optional)
7. Add scope indicator to notification tray items

### Phase 4: Polish & Extensions (Future)
**Goal**: Refinements based on usage feedback.

**Tasks:**
1. Subscription editing (PATCH trigger activities)
2. `DELETED` trigger activity for agent deletion events
3. Subscription limits / rate limiting
4. Bulk subscribe/unsubscribe operations
5. Subscription templates (pre-configured activity sets for common patterns)
6. Email notification channel integration

---

## Summary

This design extends the notification system from a start-time-only, single-agent model to a flexible subscription system with two scopes (agent, grove), subscriber-level deduplication, full CRUD lifecycle, and management through both CLI and web UI. The core changes are modest — a new column and query path in the dispatcher, new API endpoints, and new CLI commands — while preserving full backward compatibility with the existing `--notify` flag.
